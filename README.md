## GitHub org browser

A really simple tool for listing public repositories of a GitHub organization, with stats, sorting and filtering.

forked from http://mapbox.github.io/github-org-browser

Note that it uses the GitHub JSON API under the hood, so you may hit rate limit if you browse through too many organizations in a short period of time.
